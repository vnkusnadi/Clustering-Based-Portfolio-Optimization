# üî¥ Project: Clustering-Based-Portfolio-Optimization
This project is a collaborative academic exploration into portfolio optimization using clustering techniques. We aimed to investigate whether unsupervised learning models can enhance traditional momentum-based trading strategies. All strategies are backtested and evaluated based on risk-adjusted metrics.

## üìò Strategy Breakdown

### üìå Strategy 1 ‚Äî CAPM-Based Selection with GMVP Allocation
> This strategy focuses on selecting stocks using CAPM parameters and allocating capital using Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) weights.

- **Stock Selection**:
  - Stocks were selected monthly based on CAPM alpha and beta values.
  - Only stocks with \( 0 < \beta < 1 \) were considered, favoring moderately responsive stocks.
- **Portfolio Formation**:
  - Each month, 5 stocks were selected and their historical returns were collected.
  - GMVP weights were calculated using the inverse of the covariance matrix to minimize portfolio variance.
- **Capital Allocation**:
  - Monthly returns were computed using weighted combinations of selected stocks.
  - Capital was reallocated monthly based on these selections and weights.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Final capital grew from $1,000,000 to **$3,833,699**, a **+283.37%** return.
  - Monthly Sharpe: **0.176**, Annualized Sharpe: **0.608**, Max Drawdown: **-35.46%**
### üìå Strategy 2 ‚Äî KMeans Clustering with CAPM Refinement
> This enhanced strategy integrates KMeans clustering to group stocks by return features and then applies CAPM-based filtering within clusters.

- **Clustering**:
  - Stocks were grouped monthly using **KMeans** (with 5 clusters) on return-based feature matrices.
  - Each cluster was analyzed independently for stock characteristics.
- **Refined Selection**:
  - From each cluster, stocks with the best CAPM profiles (positive alpha, beta between 0 and 1) were chosen.
  - A total of 5 stocks were selected monthly from across clusters.
- **Portfolio Formation & Allocation**:
  - GMVP weights were computed as in Strategy 1 for diversification.
  - Monthly rebalancing was performed based on cluster-informed selections.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Final capital grew from $1,000,000 to **$9,150,980**, a **+815.10%** return.
  - Monthly Sharpe: **0.275**, Annualized Sharpe: **0.954**, Max Drawdown: **-22.40%**

## üß† Clustering Concept
In **Strategy 2**, we used the **KMeans clustering algorithm** to group stocks based on their **return behavior** over a rolling 3-month window. Here's how it works:
- **Feature Construction**:
  - For each month, we collected **3 months of historical returns** for each stock.
  - This return matrix served as the feature space where each stock is a data point.
- **Clustering Method**:
  - We applied **KMeans with 5 clusters** to segment stocks into behaviorally similar groups.
  - Clustering was done in the **cross-sectional space** of stocks, not across time.
- **Cluster Purpose**:
  - The goal was to group stocks that behave similarly, making it easier to identify and filter for consistent performance.
  - CAPM parameters (alpha and beta) were later used to **refine stock selection** within each cluster.
This unsupervised learning step added structure to the stock universe, helping isolate reliable alpha-generating candidates.

## üíª How to Run

    # In Jupyter Notebook
    !pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
Open the notebook Project_2_Portfolio_Management.ipynb, and run cells sequentially

## üß† What We Learned
- Applying unsupervised learning techniques like KMeans can reveal hidden structure in stock behavior.
- Momentum signals can be amplified or filtered through cluster-based stock selection.
- Portfolio construction benefits from risk-aware rebalancing rules post-clustering.
- Evaluation must account for both returns and risk (e.g., using Sharpe and drawdown).
